Minimal React Starter
---

A minimal setup to write a web application using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

Testing requires extra dependencies to [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

Initially created thanks to this great [7-step walkthrough](http://andrewhfarmer.com/build-your-own-starter/#0-intro) guide.
